### What I learned

Using mobile first approach make the work easy.
I am proud of his code makes the card group responsive:

```css
.card-group {
  max-width: 80vw;
  display: grid;
  grid: 1fr / repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus more on the cs grids t improve on layouts of the pages.
